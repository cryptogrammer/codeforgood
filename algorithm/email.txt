Warning: it's another long email from me :-) Hey bill,I hope you're having a great week. My high was this past Sunday when I watched the Academy Awards with my Mom and sister. I've watched it since I was a little kid and always try to make an effort to watch the nominated films, which makes the show more exciting. Argo won best picture, but I really think Silver Linings Playbook deserved it. My low for the week was the crappy weather. I can't wait for the sun to be shining every day!Glad to hear you enjoyed break and got some rest. Sorry to hear about the situation with that teacher. It sounds like a difficult situation. How do you think it can be better? As a leader, think about what role can you play to make it better for you, the class and your teacher.I'm really excited to discuss growth mindset this week. I've been a huge believer in this since I graduated college and worked with middle school students. A bunch of my students didn't think they would ever be good at school and would often call themselves "dumb." What I always told them was that the harder you work, the smarter you get. I like your definition and the only thing I would add is that the hard work usually doesn't happen on your own. People who are really successful usually get a lot of support.Nicki Minaj is a great example of a growth mindset paying off, but I would like to know who supported her along the way. I think in society, people tend to believe peope become successful on their own, when it's almost always a team effort. That's why parents, teachers, mentors (shoutout to me ;-)) and coaches are so important.In my own life having a growth mindset has been extremely important. This has been my first year recruiting mentors, and I never had the experience of recruiting mentors before. I had to work hard at learning how iMentor recruits and get a lot of feedback from my peers. I'm still learning a lot every day and I still make mistakes, but that's part of the process of learning and getting better. Failing is just an important as succeeding AS LONG AS you learn from your mistakes. Does that make sense?Looking forward to hearing from you on Friday!joe
